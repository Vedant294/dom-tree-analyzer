🌳 DOM Tree Analyzer

A powerful React + TypeScript based web application that allows users to analyze, visualize, and optimize DOM tree structures from HTML or JSX code.

This tool helps developers understand DOM complexity, detect performance issues, and visualize tree transformations such as binary tree conversion.

🚀 Features (Detailed)
✅ 1. HTML & JSX Parsing

Accepts raw HTML

Supports JSX structures

Converts code into structured tree data

Error handling for invalid syntax

✅ 2. Interactive DOM Tree Visualization

Expand / collapse nodes

Highlight node depth

Display element attributes

Visual tree hierarchy

✅ 3. Tree Depth & Complexity Analysis

Calculates:

Maximum depth

Average depth

Total nodes

Leaf nodes

Detects deeply nested structures

✅ 4. Performance Metrics

DOM complexity score

Render cost estimation

Optimization warnings

Heavy nesting alerts

✅ 5. Optimization Suggestions

Examples:

Reduce unnecessary div nesting

Remove redundant wrapper elements

Flatten deeply nested structures

Suggest semantic HTML usage

✅ 6. Binary Tree Conversion

Converts DOM tree to binary representation

Visualizes left-child / right-sibling model

Useful for algorithm learning

🧠 How It Works (High-Level Architecture)

User pastes HTML/JSX code

Parser converts code → AST / structured tree

Tree is transformed into internal data structure

Visualization engine renders tree recursively

Metrics engine calculates:

Depth

Node count

Complexity score

Optimization module generates suggestions

Optional binary tree transformation applied
